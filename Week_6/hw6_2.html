   <h2>THE TELL-TALE HEART</h2>
   <img src="house.png" alt="house icon" class="house">
  
<p>True&#33; &mdash;nervous &mdash;very&#44; very dreadfully nervous I had been and am&#59; but why will you say that I am mad&#63; The disease had sharpened my senses &mdash;not destroyed &mdash;not dulled them&#46; Above all was the sense of hearing acute&#46; I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth&#46; I heard many things in hell&#46; How&#44; then&#44; am I mad&#63; Hearken&#33; and observe how healthily &mdash;how calmly I can tell you the whole story&#46;</p>

<p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain&#59; but once conceived&#44; it haunted me day and night&#46; Object there was none&#46; Passion there was none&#46; I loved the old man&#46; He had never wronged me&#46; He had never given me insult&#46; For his gold I had no desire&#46; I think it was his eye&#33; yes&#44; it was this&#33; He had the eye of a vulture &mdash;a pale blue eye&#44; with a film over it&#46; Whenever it fell upon me&#44; my blood ran cold&#59; and so by degrees &mdash;very gradually &mdash;I made up my mind to take the life of the old man&#44; and thus rid myself of the eye forever&#46;</p>

<p>Now this is the point&#46; You fancy me mad&#46; Madmen know nothing&#46; But you should have seen me&#46; You should have seen how wisely I proceeded &mdash;with what caution &mdash;with what foresight &mdash;with what dissimulation I went to work&#33; I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him&#46; And every night&#44; about midnight&#44; I turned the latch of his door and opened it &mdash;oh so gently&#33; And then&#44; when I had made an opening sufficient for my head&#44; I put in a dark lantern&#44; all closed&#44; closed&#44; that no light shone out&#44; and then I thrust in my head&#46; Oh&#44; you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in&#33; I moved it slowly &mdash;very&#44; very slowly&#44; so that I might not disturb the old man's sleep&#46; It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed&#46; Ha&#33; would a madman have been so wise as this&#44; And then&#44; when my head was well in the room&#44; I undid the lantern cautiously&#45;oh&#44; so cautiously &mdash;cautiously &#40;for the hinges creaked&#41; &mdash;I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye&#46; And this I did for seven long nights &mdash;every night just at midnight &mdash;but I found the eye always closed&#59; and so it was impossible to do the work&#59; for it was not the old man who vexed me&#44; but his Evil Eye&#46; And every morning&#44; when the day broke&#44; I went boldly into the chamber&#44; and spoke courageously to him&#44; calling him by name in a hearty tone&#44; and inquiring how he has passed the night&#46; So you see he would have been a very profound old man&#44; indeed&#44; to suspect that every night&#44; just at twelve&#44; I looked in upon him while he slept&#46;</p>
    
<p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door&#46; A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine&#46; Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers &mdash;of my sagacity&#46; I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph&#46; To think that there I was&#44; opening the door&#44; little by little&#44; and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts&#46; I fairly chuckled at the idea&#59; and perhaps he heard me&#59; for he moved on the bed suddenly&#44; as if startled&#46; Now you may think that I drew back &mdash;but no&#46; His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness&#44; &#40;for the shutters were close fastened&#44; through fear of robbers&#44;&#41; and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door&#44; and I kept pushing it on steadily&#44; steadily&#46; I had my head in&#44; and was about to open the lantern&#44; when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening&#44; and the old man sprang up in bed&#44; crying out &mdash;&#34;Who's there&#63;&#34; I kept quite still and said nothing&#46; For a whole hour I did not move a muscle&#44; and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down&#46; He was still sitting up in the bed listening&#59; &mdash;just as I have done&#44; night after night&#44; hearkening to the death watches in the wall&#46;</p>

<p>Presently I heard a slight groan&#44; and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror&#46; It was not a groan of pain or of grief &mdash;oh&#44; no&#33; &mdash;it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe&#46; I knew the sound well&#46; Many a night&#44; just at midnight&#44; when all the world slept&#44; it has welled up from my own bosom&#44; deepening&#44; with its dreadful echo&#44; the terrors that distracted me&#46; I say I knew it well&#46; I knew what the old man felt&#44; and pitied him&#44; although I chuckled at heart&#46; I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise&#44; when he had turned in the bed&#46; His fears had been ever since growing upon him&#46; He had been trying to fancy them causeless&#44; but could not&#46; He had been saying to himself &mdash;&#34;It is nothing but the wind in the chimney &mdash;it is only a mouse crossing the floor&#44;&#34; or &#34;It is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp&#46;&#34; Yes&#44; he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions&#58; but he had found all in vain&#46; All in vain&#59; because Death&#44; in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him&#44; and enveloped the victim&#46; And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel &mdash;although he neither saw nor heard &mdash;to feel the presence of my head within the room&#46;</p>

<p>When I had waited a long time&#44; very patiently&#44; without hearing him lie down&#44; I resolved to open a little &mdash;a very&#44; very little crevice in the lantern&#46; So I opened it &mdash;you cannot imagine how stealthily&#44; stealthily &mdash;until&#44; at length a simple dim ray&#44; like the thread of the spider&#44; shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye&#46; It was open &mdash;wide&#44; wide open &mdash;and I grew furious as I gazed upon it&#46; I saw it with perfect distinctness &mdash;all a dull blue&#44; with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man's face or person&#58; for I had directed the ray as if by instinct&#44; precisely upon the damned spot&#46; And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over&#45;acuteness of the sense&#63; &mdash;now&#44; I say&#44; there came to my ears a low&#44; dull&#44; quick sound&#44; such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton&#46; I knew that sound well&#44; too&#46; It was the beating of the old man's heart&#46; It increased my fury&#44; as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage&#46;</p>

<p>But even yet I refrained and kept still&#46; I scarcely breathed&#46; I held the lantern motionless&#46; I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve&#46; Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased&#46; It grew quicker and quicker&#44; and louder and louder every instant&#46; The old man's terror must have been extreme&#33; It grew louder&#44; I say&#44; louder every moment&#33; &mdash;do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous&#58; so I am&#46; And now at the dead hour of the night&#44; amid the dreadful silence of that old house&#44; so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror&#46; Yet&#44; for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still&#46; But the beating grew louder&#44; louder&#33; I thought the heart must burst&#46; And now a new anxiety seized me &mdash;the sound would be heard by a neighbour&#33; The old man's hour had come&#33; With a loud yell&#44; I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room&#46; He shrieked once &mdash;once only&#46; In an instant I dragged him to the floor&#44; and pulled the heavy bed over him&#46; I then smiled gaily&#44; to find the deed so far done&#46; But&#44; for many minutes&#44; the heart beat on with a muffled sound&#46; This&#44; however&#44; did not vex me&#59; it would not be heard through the wall&#46; At length it ceased&#46; The old man was dead&#46; I removed the bed and examined the corpse&#46; Yes&#44; he was stone&#44; stone dead&#46; I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes&#46; There was no pulsation&#46; He was stone dead&#46; His eye would trouble me no more&#46;</p>

<p>If still you think me mad&#44; you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body&#46; The night waned&#44; and I worked hastily&#44; but in silence&#46; First of all I dismembered the corpse&#46; I cut off the head and the arms and the legs&#46; I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber&#44; and deposited all between the scantlings&#46; I then replaced the boards so cleverly&#44; so cunningly&#44; that no human eye &mdash;not even his &mdash;could have detected any thing wrong&#46; There was nothing to wash out &mdash;no stain of any kind &mdash;no blood&#45;spot whatever&#46; I had been too wary for that&#46; A tub had caught all &mdash;ha&#33; ha&#33; When I had made an end of these labors&#44; it was four o'clock &mdash;still dark as midnight&#46; As the bell sounded the hour&#44; there came a knocking at the street door&#46; I went down to open it with a light heart&#44; &mdash;for what had I now to fear&#63; There entered three men&#44; who introduced themselves&#44; with perfect suavity&#44; as officers of the police&#46; A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night&#59; suspicion of foul play had been aroused&#59; information had been lodged at the police office&#44; and they &#40;the officers&#41; had been deputed to search the premises&#46; I smiled&#44; &mdash;for what had I to fear&#63; I bade the gentlemen welcome&#46; The shriek&#44; I said&#44; was my own in a dream&#46; The old man&#44; I mentioned&#44; was absent in the country&#46; I took my visitors all over the house&#46; I bade them search &mdash;search well&#46; I led them&#44; at length&#44; to his chamber&#46; I showed them his treasures&#44; secure&#44; undisturbed&#46; In the enthusiasm of my confidence&#44; I brought chairs into the room&#44; and desired them here to rest from their fatigues&#44; while I myself&#44; in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph&#44; placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim&#46;</p>

<p>The officers were satisfied&#46; My manner had convinced them&#46; I was singularly at ease&#46; They sat&#44; and while I answered cheerily&#44; they chatted of familiar things&#46; But&#44; ere long&#44; I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone&#46; My head ached&#44; and I fancied a ringing in my ears&#58; but still they sat and still chatted&#46; The ringing became more distinct&#58; &mdash;It continued and became more distinct&#58; I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling&#58; but it continued and gained definiteness &mdash;until&#44; at length&#44; I found that the noise was not within my ears&#46; No doubt I now grew very pale&#59; &mdash;but I talked more fluently&#44; and with a heightened voice&#46; Yet the sound increased &mdash;and what could I do&#63; It was a low&#44; dull&#44; quick sound &mdash;much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton&#46; I gasped for breath &mdash;and yet the officers heard it not&#46; I talked more quickly &mdash;more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased&#46; I arose and argued about trifles&#44; in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased&#46; Why would they not be gone&#63; I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides&#44; as if excited to fury by the observations of the men &mdash;but the noise steadily increased&#46; Oh God&#33; what could I do&#63; I foamed &mdash;I raved &mdash;I swore&#33; I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting&#44; and grated it upon the boards&#44; but the noise arose over all and continually increased&#46; It grew louder &mdash;louder &mdash;louder&#33; And still the men chatted pleasantly&#44; and smiled&#46; Was it possible they heard not&#63; Almighty God&#33; &mdash;no&#44; no&#33; They heard&#33; &mdash;they suspected&#33; &mdash;they knew&#33; &mdash;they were making a mockery of my horror&#33;&#45;this I thought&#44; and this I think&#46; But anything was better than this agony&#33; Anything was more tolerable than this derision&#33; I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer&#33; I felt that I must scream or die&#33; and now &mdash;again&#33; &mdash;hark&#33; louder&#33; louder&#33; louder&#33; louder&#33;</p>

<p>&#34;Villains&#33;&#34; I shrieked&#44; &#34;dissemble no more&#33; I admit the deed&#33; &mdash;tear up the planks&#33; here&#44; here&#33; &mdash;It is the beating of his hideous heart&#33;&#34;</p>
