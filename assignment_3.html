<h1>Assignment 3 - HTML Page WebDAV
</h1>
<p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web and the web browser called WorldWideWeb which was renamed Nexus to avoid confusion, but ended up discontinued in 1994. It could view AND edit webpages and was the first WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) HTML editor.</p>

<p>Eventually browsers became read-only as web browsers grew in popularity. There were risks of corruption and would need highly skilled developers monitoring. A group of people wanted to bring it back, and so Jim Whitehead organized a meeting with members of the World Wide Web Consortium in 1996 to discuss the problem of authoring on the web and created the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) which is “an open standards organization, which develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).” And eventually webDAV was created.</p>

<p>The advantages of using webDAV in your business is the ability to edit files directly from the server directly from your computer. This is good because developers from all over the world are able to work on the same project together (called collaborative authoring.) This saves time and allows for more work to be done on a project rather than having 1 person or a small team working on it from one location. Access to files requires a username and password.</p>

<h3>Other advantages include</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Operating system integration</li>
  <li>Free to use</li>
  <li>Close integration with web services</li>
  <li>Version Control</li>
  <li>Transport encryption</li>
  <li>Remote access</li>
  <li>Centralized storage</li>
  <li>Version Control</li>
  <li>File locking</li>
</ul>

<p>I have had personal experience with systems like this during my time as a graphic designer. In first job in advertising, when in the office we used a shared server that we could access as long as we were on the correct wifi, however if we were to leave the building, we would then have to login from a different site in order to access files.</p>

<p>Today, I use GoogleDrive and Dropbox daily for collaborative work. During meetings we all open Google Sheets to view information and watch real-time edits applied to the document. Other companies that use webDAV are Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, Box.com, WordPress, Drupal, Microsoft Sharepoint, Subversion, Git, Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, and Adobe.</p>

<h3>Alternatives today to webDAV are</h3>
<ul>
  <li>FTP</li>
  <li>SSH</li>
  <li>Wikis</li>
  <li>Distributed filesystems</li>
  <li>Cloud file storage</li>
</ul>
