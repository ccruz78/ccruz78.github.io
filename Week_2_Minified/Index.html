Currently, I work as a creative director for a franchising company in San Jose. In the last year I have hired two employees for the very first time and I am working on becoming a strong and effective leader. I am working through this program because I would like to expand my design knowledge so that I may have more control of website design instead of relying on template sites such as Wordpress. Although it may seem like the easier route, every now and again there are limitations that I come across that I wished I knew how to work through on my own.</p><p>Some of my hobbies inlcude ice skating, reading, calligraphy, and knitting. I find each relaxing in their own way and I like having a screen break. I also enjoy learning about astronomy and cosmology, one of my favorite scientists is Stephen Hawking, he was funny, witty and eloquent. Some of my favorite quotes are...</p><blockquote> &ldquo;We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.&rdquo; <br>&mdash; Stephen Hawking </blockquote> <blockquote> &ldquo;Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.&rdquo; <br>&mdash; Stephen Hawking </blockquote> <hr> </div><div class="footer"> <ul> <li><a href="Weekly_Assignments.html">Weekly Assignments</a></li><li><a href="Tips_Tricks.html">Tips &amp; Tricks</a></li></ul> </div></body></html>
