    <h1>Monroe Middle School</h1>
    <p>I atteneded Monroe Middle School in San Jose, CA. At the time that I went, it taught 5<sup>th</sup> - 8<sup>th</sup> graders, but looking at their website it looks like they have now shifted to teaching 6<sup>th</sup> - 8<sup>th</sup> grade. This is what their website has to say about the school. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Middle school is a time of discovery, growth, and change, and our staff excels in supporting students academically, socially, and emotionally during these formative years.  We believe in the importance of a strong home and school connection, and we work with families to nurture respectful and responsible students.  We are passionate about developing the whole child and allowing students to explore new ideas and experiences.  Students engage in collaborative problem-solving that fosters critical thinking, communication, and creativity.</p>
    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
    <p> Middle School strives to establish a safe, supportive, academically-challenging culture that encourages all students to become confident and creative critical-thinkers actively engaged in learning.</p>
